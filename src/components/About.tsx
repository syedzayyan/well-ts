            <p>I should have chosen a more intuitive name but ughh, I have bought the domain already.</p>

            <p>You know well plates? I have seen people printing layouts of them and the scribbling concentration values on them? Is that intuitive? Not at all. Is that a waste of paper? Yes. And then on top of that if you were to make a presentation of the well plates for example teaching students how the colors magically change when you add trypsin to a protein. I was there once. Hence this tool(?). It lets you do all of that.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make Layouts on a computer, rather than scribbling</li>
                <li>Add text and color to the wells</li>
                <li>Save the layouts locally, for probably future edits. (I don&#39;t want to fund or make a backend for this)</li>
                <li>Export the wells into an Excel sheet (CSV) to maybe analyse data.</li>
                <li>Export the layout into a picture format or SVG (working on this) for a presentation maybe.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This is made using React. I used Typescript, because I hate headaches and actually I wanted to learn Typescript. Using it for a project seemed more intuitive. If you want to contribute to the code, please feel free to make a Pull Request on the Github Repo. I probably would fix it soon enough. If you find issues, again make a pull request or email me. I&#39;ll probably take some time but feel free to follow-up. I forget sometime.</p>
