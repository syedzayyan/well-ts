# Well Plate Layout Maker

I should have chosen a more intuitive name but ughh, I have bought the domain already.

### What is it?

You know well plates? I have seen people printing layouts of them and the scribbling concentration values on them? Is that intuitive? Not at all. Is that a waste of paper? Yes. And then on top of that if you were to make a presentation of the well plates for example teaching students how the colors magically change when you add trypsin to a protein. I was there once. Hence this tool(?). It lets you do all of that.

- Make Layouts on a computer, rather than scribbling
- Add text and color to the wells
- Save the layouts locally, for probably future edits. (I don't want to fund or make a backend for this)
- Export the wells into an Excel sheet (CSV) to maybe analyse data.
- Export the layout into a picture format or SVG (working on this) for a presentation maybe.

### Contributing didgeridoo

This is made using React. I used Typescript, because I hate headaches and actually I wanted to learn Typescript. Using it for a project seemed more intuitive. If you want to contribute to the code, please feel free to make a Pull Request on the Github Repo. I probably would fix it soon enough. If you find issues, again make a pull request or email me. I'll probably take some time but feel free to follow-up. I forget sometime.
